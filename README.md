### Challenges faced
The main challages I faced when creating the game were the triggers to set the balloons up.
I also found it different to create game space as to where you would pop the balloons and getting them to disapper, or rather pop.
Styling was also a concern for me...getting the right tone and feel for the game



### Improvements
I would have loved to put stages and levels.
If I did add stages and levels I would have had different music for each level and stage
